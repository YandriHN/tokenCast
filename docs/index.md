# TokenCast NFT Art Display

## Supported Wallets

To login to TokenCast, you can use any of the following NFT wallets.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download)
- [Wallet Connect Family of Wallets](https://walletconnect.org/wallets)
- [Authereum](https://authereum.com/)

## Instructions

1. Setup a TokenCast device. Choose from our [FireTV](./firetv), [Android](./android), or [Raspberry Pi](./raspi) clients.
2. If your wallet is on your phone, you can scan the QR code. Otherwise, [login to TokenCast](https://tokencast.net/Account). We highly recommend the [Metamask mobile wallet](https://metamask.io/download).
3. In the menu, select "New Device" and enter your device identifier if it's not already registered.
4. Select your NFT and click Cast.

## Choosing your client

A [FireTV stick](./firetv) is a great introductory device. It's low cost, easy to setup, and compatible with most TVs. The [Android App](./android) is better if you have a tablet or manufactured device that you'd like to turn into an NFT display. [Raspberry Pi](./raspi) is suited for DIYers that want more customization options.

## Features

### ENS Support
If you've setup a reverse resolver for your Ethereum address, your ENS name will be displayed instead of your Ethereum address.

### Color Swatches
Before displaying a token, you can make some customizations including updating the image size and background color. The background color swatch is algorithmically derived from the token image. Here are some examples:
